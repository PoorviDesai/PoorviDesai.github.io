  <h1 id="title">Steve Jobs</h1>
  
  <div id="tribute-info">
  <p>The man who redefined innovation. Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobsâ€™s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.</p>

  <h2 id="title">Some of his most innovative creations:</h2>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple I:</strong> Jobs and his co-founder Steve Wozniak created the Apple I, a personal computer with no monitor, no keyboard and no mouse. </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Apple II:</b> Launched in 1977, Apple II was an improved and updated version of the previous model, this time with a keyboard, monitor and a new operating system.</li><br>
    <li><b>The Macintosh:</b> With the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, called Mac for short, personal computing took a giant leap forward with its innovative graphics interface and mouse, an efficient, easy-to-use substitute for the keyboard, although the keyboard was also part of the package.</li><br>
    <li><b>Pixar:</b> Ever restless and looking for new opportunities, Jobs bought an obscure computer graphics firm from the director of "Star Wars," George Lucas.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>NeXT:</b> In one of those rare ironies in the business world, Steve Jobs was fired in 1985 from his own company by John Scully, the executive Jobs hired to manage the firm. </li><br>
    <li><b>The Cube:</b> Nothing like it had ever been seen before: a compact desktop computer contained in a clear plastic cube. </li><br>
    <li><b>The iPod:</b> The iPod, launched in 2001, was basically a computer hard drive with some functional embellishments, with a set of earbuds and a control system.</li><br>
    <li><B>The MacBook:</b> Launched in 2006, the MacBook laptop computer had all the capabilities of a desktop computer. Eventually, the MacBook outsold all competing laptops.</li><br>
    <li><b>The iPhone:</b> Fitting snugly into the palm of your hand, the iPhone, released in 2007, could send and receive telephone calls, play movies, retrieve your e-mail, surf the net, and send and receive text messages.</li><br>
    <li><b>The iPad Tablet:</b> Another revolutionary innovation by Steve Jobs, the iPad tablet had many of the capabilities of a laptop computer. </li><br>
  </ul>
